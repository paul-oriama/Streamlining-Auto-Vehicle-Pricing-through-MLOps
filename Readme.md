# Used Cars Price Prediction MLOps Pipeline

## Problem Statement

The automobile market in Los Vegas is booming, with increasing demand for luxury and non-luxury vehicles. A prominent dealership is struggling with **inconsistent and inefficient pricing strategies** due to manual processes and disjointed systems. These challenges lead to:

* Prone-to-error pricing evaluations
* Delayed model updates
* Difficulty scaling operations on rising demand
* Revenue loss and reduced customer trust

To address these inefficiencies, the dealership aims to implement a **scalable, automated, and data-driven pricing system** backed by MLOps practices.
